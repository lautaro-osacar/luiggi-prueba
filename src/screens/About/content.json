  "description": "In the fragments of a scene standardised by capitalism, we emerge as a anonymous, unnamed and non-profit booking agency, believing that the need to re design some aspects of the music industry, such as conventional DJ agencies, are the key to stop serious problematics and inequalities that affects all the cultural and creative aspects of our lives.\n\n Nowadays, success in any creative profession is measured by popularity or followers. Although none of those things equate to quality. DJs are forced to invest more time and energy on their image and audience expectations, than they actually do in their creative process. This imposition of the music industry is driving both, audience and DJs, into a narrow-mindedness spot where both will do whatever is expected from them, and everyone start to copy each other, leaving no opportunity to think about their own role.\n\nWe give artist the chance to be represented with fair values and let them stay independent, making them know that they are not on their own to face the challenge to be themselves.\n\nWe offer to the promoters the possibility to book authenticity and attach importance to the real talent of DJs.\n\nWe provide the audience the opportunity to make up their own mind on how to react, and celebrate diversity, equality, and life with its endless of possibilities.",
  "phrase": "Using our booking service you are supporting the artists directly",
