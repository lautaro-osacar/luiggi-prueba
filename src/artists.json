Her last album “Hyäne”, released in 2020 at Zurich based Lustpoderosa, is a neo-ceremonial call to rethink entrenched structures without missing the turmoil of today’s political landscape. Sensitive and unique, the record refuses to settle on a specific gender and revisit early days of Minimal Wave and Electro, with a contemporary and very own Marlene’s interpretation of Letfield Music. Her own voice, usually used in most of her tracks, completes the structure of her music with a personal imprint, but what really drives the message home, is the genuineness in which it is delivered and lived by the artist,  that is constantly rejecting the idea of being typical or ordinary.\n\nAs much as Marlene enjoys her sonic adventures, she is also a writer. In 2019 she published her debut novel “M”, co-authored with Anna Gien. The book explores female sexuality and display the systematic oppression of women in the art scene.",

Naturally, he does it on vinyl.\n\nAs Co-founder of Libertine Records, he has curated a catalog with underground icons such as Le Syndicat Electronique, Dynarec, The Dexorcist, Neuro-d, Gosub, David Carreta, among others. This list is far from complete but does describe the exquisite personal taste of Sbri and the fierce range of his DJ sets.\n\nIn 2019, he release his first double album, Induestries 01. A high voltage record that represent his vision of Letfield music. Charged with 606 and 707 sharp patterns, acid lines and dark pads, the record was compared by blogs as a reminiscent of The Hague/West Coast scene of early 00’s and the dark, brooding, Chicago jackbeat associated with Traxx label’s Nation.\n\nWhile Sbri is working on a new double album, his never ending quest for new and unearth music continues and his record collection still expanding, leaving no doubt that we will hear a lot more from him in the next years to come and his creative journey is just starting.",
